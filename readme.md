Restaurant industry is normally a fast-paced environment in which customer satisfaction and efficiency in service delivery are crucial keys to success. In today's digital era, the website presence of a restaurant is important for serving customers efficiently. The goal of this project is to create a web application using the MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js) stack. This application will provide customers with easy access to the restaurant’s menu, general information, and a booking system. It will also serve as an essential tool for communicating the restaurant’s values and history to potential customers, offering users access to the restaurant’s menu, and providing general information about the establishment.
The application will consist of four primary pages: Home, Menu, About, and Queue (Ticket System). The Home page will offer general information about the restaurant, while the Menu page will showcase the dishes. The About page will provide details on the restaurant’s history, values, and mission. Lastly, the Queue page will manage customer waitlists through a digital ticketing system, allowing users to join the queue remotely and reduce the frustration of long wait times.
